## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register and log in with validation. User data is stored in local storage for simplicity in this mini project.

- **Home Page**: The home page includes a top menu, an image slider for ads, and categories of food.

- **Category Page**: Each category has its own page with a list of foods related to that category.

- **Single Food Page**: Clicking on a food item in a category navigates the user to a detailed page about that specific food.

- **Profile Page**: Users have a profile page where they can view and edit their personal information.

- **Cart Page (Redux)**: The cart page is implemented with Redux, allowing users to perform the following actions:
  - Add items to the cart
  - Delete items from the cart
  - Clear the entire cart
  - Adjust item quantities with a responsive total
